# BI PROJECT CAR
This repository contains code and notebooks for the BI Project Car.
This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning models. The dataset includes various car-related features, and through data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling, we aim to build accurate prediction models.
⚙️ Steps

Import Libraries – Essential Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).

Read Data – Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.

Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

Modeling – Build and evaluate two models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation – Compare models using metrics such as R² score, MAE, and RMSE.

📊 Results

Linear Regression provides a baseline model.

Random Forest improves prediction accuracy by capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🎯 Goal

To identify the best-performing model for predicting car prices and gain insights from the dataset through exploratory data analysis.
